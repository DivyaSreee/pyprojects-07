# Mini SuperMarket

This is a simple Python script that simulates a mini supermarket. The user can view a list of items, select items to purchase, and view a final bill with GST added.

The script prompts the user to enter their name and then displays a list of items available for purchase. Each item has a fixed price. The user can select items to add to their shopping cart and specify the quantity for each item. Once the user is done shopping, the script calculates the total price, adds GST, and prints a detailed bill.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Modules Used

- `datetime`: This module is used to get the current date and time, which is printed on the bill.

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
2. Download the script to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal window.
4. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
5. Run the script by typing `python script_name.py` in the terminal, replacing `script_name.py` with the name of the Python script.
6. Follow the prompts in the terminal to use the mini supermarket.
